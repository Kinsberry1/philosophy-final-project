# Philosophy Final Project – PHIL 1313 (Spring 2025)

## 📘 Project Overview
This is my final project for **Introduction to Philosophy (PHIL 1313)** at North American University, under the instruction of Professor Stacey M. Burleson.

The project explores ethical theories through the lens of superhero narratives, focusing specifically on **Batman** (*The Dark Knight*) and **Captain America** (*Civil War*). It compares **Kantian Duty Ethics** and **Utilitarianism** while analyzing the moral decisions faced by these characters.
