      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>This project explores Aristotle's virtue ethics, which emphasizes the development of good character and virtuous habits as the foundation for ethical behavior. It examines how cultivating moral virtues can guide personal decisions, foster discipline, and shape one‚Äôs identity through everyday choices.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>Virtue ethics focuses on who we are as individuals rather than just what we do. This perspective encourages us to become more thoughtful, courageous, and just in how we engage with the world and others. Reflecting on these principles has deepened my understanding of what it means to live a life grounded in values and purpose.</p>
