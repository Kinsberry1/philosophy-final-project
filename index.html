  <h1 class="paper-title">Justice, Duty, and the Greater Good: Ethical Conflicts in <em>The Dark Knight</em> and <em>Captain America: Civil War</em></h1>

  <p>Superhero films do more than entertain their audiences; they can cause them to reflect and explore moral and philosophical issues surrounding justice, responsibility, and ethical choices. Two prominent examples are The Dark Knight and Captain America: Civil War. These movies not only captivate audiences with their action-packed scenes but also prompt deep reflections on the nature of heroism and the ethical dilemmas that come with great power. These films seem to challenge viewers to consider how complicated justice is and the consequences of questionable decisions made in the heat of the moment. While both films take place in quite different universes, they share a common theme: the struggle between differing moral philosophies and the complicated aftermath of ethical decision-making when faced with extraordinary challenges.</p>

  <p>In The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne, secretly Batman, is faced with a major moral dilemma when dealing with the Joker's terrorism. The Joker constantly pushes Batman to violate his personal code against killing, exploiting the city's descent into chaos. However, Batman refuses to kill, holding firmly to his internal principles, even when doing so would save lives in the short term. His refusal to kill even the Joker, who has cost countless lives, echoes Immanuel Kant’s deontological philosophy — that moral acts must be performed out of duty rather than based on consequences.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Batman’s use of invasive surveillance technology to find the Joker — hacking into every citizen’s phone in Gotham — introduces an ethical compromise. While the surveillance works, Batman later acknowledges the danger of such power and destroys the technology after it serves its purpose. This reflects a utilitarian move: sacrificing a principle temporarily to achieve a greater good, before returning to a principled stance. Thus, The Dark Knight presents a complex moral portrait of a hero who wrestles with ethical boundaries.</p>

  <p>Captain America: Civil War presents a different ethical landscape. When the Sokovia Accords are introduced, forcing government oversight over the Avengers, Steve Rogers (Captain America) refuses to sign. His objection is rooted in the belief that individuals, not institutions, should be responsible for their actions. Captain America embodies Kant’s emphasis on autonomy and personal moral responsibility. He chooses to act according to conscience, even when that places him in direct conflict with friends, allies, and governments. Tony Stark (Iron Man), in contrast, supports the Accords, reflecting a utilitarian mindset that seeks to minimize harm even if it means sacrificing individual freedoms.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, both The Dark Knight and Captain America: Civil War showcase the complex relationship between duty and outcomes. Batman and Captain America prioritize principled action over pragmatic concerns. They remind audiences that true heroism lies not only in physical courage but in moral steadfastness. Even when facing defeat, loss, or misunderstanding, their commitment to doing what is right — regardless of consequences — illustrates the enduring importance of Kantian ethics.</p>
